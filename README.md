Getting started: To download the app, follow the following steps:

npm install -g @ionic/cli
npm install
navigate into parley folder
ionic serve

What technologies we used: The front-end of Parley uses a combination of React and Ionic to render our app. We chose Ionic with the intention that anyone in any place could join a talk, therefore Parley should be a mobile-first experience.

Works in progress (status):
  Session page:
    - allow users/host to mute when they are in the streaming session (backend team is working on it).

Idea for future development:
  Login Page:
    - In addition to google account, allow users to login with other credentail accounts for example Facebook.
  Profile Page:
    - Allow users to be able to send and receive messages with other users
    - Allow users to be able to subscribe to other users and content tags
    - Provide a way for users to to shedule and rsvp to future sessions
  Feed Page:
    - Allow users to filter the feed by date and popularity
    - Enable users to like and leave the comment and share sessions
    - Provide users a way to receive opt in notifications of their upcoming sessions and the ones they are RSVPâ€™d to
    - Allow users to continue listening to the streams/records while navigating to other pages
  Session Page:
    - allow users to scroll the play bar to skip while they are listening to the records
